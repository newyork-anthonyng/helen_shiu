      Borrowing from the folklore of storks delivering babies, I composed a story to build upon the Nest brand and created packaging for chocolate with mothers of newborns in mind. The story goesâ€¦
    </p>

    <p>
      Nothing will ever be the same again as a mother-to-be prepares to sacrifice her chocolate addiction so her newborn could have a healthy beginning. Noticing the cries of these mothers-to-be, storks from all over the world set out on an epic journey to find the best cocoa beans from the Amazon region. After successfully harvesting the cocoa beans, they deliver them to a skilled chocolatier who then carefully crafts them into fine white chocolate. Mothers with newborns will never have to sacrifice again.
