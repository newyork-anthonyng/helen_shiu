      Combining my favorite childhood Disney character, Winnie the Pooh, and my
      interest in paper crafts, I redesigned the book cover for The Complete
      Tales of Winnie the Pooh by A. A. Milne with my interpretation of the
      stories using card stock paper. The book cover draws from memories of
      creating elementary school diorama projects, light hearted life lessons,
      and never ending adventures with friends.

      With more card stock paper available to use, I continued building on my
      initial creation as a personal side project.
